Injector and Ignition (on/off) scheduling (structs).

This scheduler is designed to maintain 2 schedules for use by the fuel and ignition systems.
It functions by waiting for the overflow vectors from each of the timers in use to overflow, which triggers an interrupt.

## Technical

Currently I am prescaling the 16-bit timers to 256 for injection and 64 for ignition.
This means that the counter increments every 16us (injection) / 4uS (ignition) and will overflow every 1048576uS.

    Max Period = (Prescale)*(1/Frequency)*(2^17)

For more details see https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer1/ (OLD: http://playground.arduino.cc/code/timer1 ).
This means that the precision of the scheduler is:

- 16uS (+/- 8uS of target) for fuel
- 4uS (+/- 2uS) for ignition

## Features

This differs from most other schedulers in that its calls are non-recurring (ie when you schedule an event at a certain time and once it has occurred,
it will not reoccur unless you explicitly ask/re-register for it).
Each timer can have only 1 callback associated with it at any given time. If you call the setCallback function a 2nd time,
the original schedule will be overwritten and not occur.

## Timer identification

Arduino timers usage for injection and ignition schedules:
- timer3 is used for schedule 1(?) (fuel 1,2,3,4 ign 7,8)
- timer4 is used for schedule 2(?) (fuel 5,6 ign 4,5,6)
- timer5 is used ... (fuel 7,8, ign 1,2,3)

Timers 3,4 and 5 are 16-bit timers (ie count to 65536).
See page 136 of the processors datasheet: http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2549.pdf .

256 prescale gives tick every 16uS.
256 prescale gives overflow every 1048576uS (This means maximum wait time is 1.0485 seconds).
